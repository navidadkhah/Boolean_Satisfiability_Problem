Solving Random 3-SAT(Boolean satisfiability problem) using Evolutionary algorithms like Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing.

# DataSet
You can access the data set with this [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xnXeA9t6GqsySeu5G3Bz8MYZDEAWG7iM/view).

The Dataset is a .cnf file and in the first row has two numbers n and m.
- n is the number of variables and m is the number of instructions.
- In the next m rows, each row contains an instruction for three variables.
- The negative form of each variable is shown with a hyphen(-).
- we use ```OR``` operation between each variable and use ```AND``` operation between each row.
